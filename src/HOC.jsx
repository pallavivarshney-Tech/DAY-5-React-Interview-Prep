     <h2>High Order Component in react js ?</h2>
     <p>A higher-order component (HOC) is a function that takes a component and returns a new component. Basically, it's a pattern that is derived from React's compositional nature. We call them pure components because they can accept any dynamically provided child component but they won't modify or copy any behavior from their input components. const EnhancedComponent = higherOrderComponent(WrappedComponent)</p>
     Example:
    </div>
  )
}

export default HOC
